<h3>About Website</h3>
<p>This website was created to web development while building and planning out my next computer setup. I chose to create this site for my WEBD221: Intermediate Web Development class at American Military University as computer are a hobby of mine to mess and tinker with when I have spare time. I have been very happen with my multiple computer setup but their age is showing and none of them can run VR well enough to enjoy. My goal for this website is to give me a website to development my skills with website design and programming, as well as, give my a website to organize my setup and thoughts about <b>My Ultimate Computer Setup</b>!</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Cory and I have been working on my IT degree for a long while. Just finished WEBD121 after being out of school for over 2 years. I guess you can say I am maybe a Junior based off of timing. I have like 12 more classes I think still, but I am only taking 1 at a time now really. I am currently in the Air Force, TSgt. My job is an Airborne Systems Engineer which is basically tech support in the air! Honestly now I am mostly doing paperwork and training material stuff. I live in Omaha, NE and have been here now for 12 years.</p>

<p>Personally, I am a little all over the place when it comes to hobbies. Mostly in the technical field, but I also like the outdoors. Been crazy busy with life now though, I have a 11 year old girl starting that meh stage, a 2 year old boy with lots of medical stuff and a 7 month old girl who is loud. I am still debating starting school up again but I really feel like I need to.</p>

<p>I would love to learn more about anything technical and usable in the day to day.</p>

<p>Personally, I am a little all over the place when it comes to hobbies. Mostly in the technical field, but I also like the outdoors. Been crazy busy with life now though, I have a 10 year old girl starting that meh stage, a 2 year old boy with lots of medical stuff and a 6 month old girl who is loud. I am still debating starting school up again but I really feel like I need to.</p>

<p>For this class I really hope to gain a better understanding of web design and structure mostly. I like computers and anything electronic so this would just give me another insight in to stuff I use every day.</p> 

<p>I am really interested in <b>HTML5 WebGL</b> and would really like to learn that.</p>
